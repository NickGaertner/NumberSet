A small library to perform set operations on number sets that can be represented by a finite amount of intervals.

**NumberSet** provides two immutable classes -
[NumberSet](https://nickgaertner.github.io/numberset/classes/NumberSet.html) and
[Interval](https://nickgaertner.github.io/numberset/classes/Interval.html) -
capable of common set operations.
This library's focus is not on querying, although possible. If your primary use case is querying and you find this library lacking, consider using [interval trees](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=interval%20tree&ranking=optimal) instead.

The library supports closed, open and half-open intervals (bounded and unbounded) and sets build out of them. Both intervals and sets can be constructed from string representations.
See the
[documentation](https://nickgaertner.github.io/numberset)
for more details.

### Installation

```console
npm install numberset
```

### Usage

// TODO create intervals

// TODO create interval from alias

// TODO create sets

// TODO perform basic operations

// TODO use number transform
